Playing with PixiJs

This needs to be run from a web server or javascript won't be allowed to pull in the resources, but locally is fine if you have something like WAMP / XAMPP running. I installed XAMPP on my PC and whacked the files in the htdocs folder it makes (you don't need any of the mysql stuff - I just installed apache and unticked everything else I could)

XAMPP: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
